 <a href="http://colquitt2.schooldesk.net/"><b>High School</b></a>
 </h2>
 <p>
 As a high school student, I was active in both my school and the community. I went to Colquitt County High School
 in Moultrie Georgia, which just so happened to be the only high school in the county. In school, I was active in 
 the KEY Club and as a member of the tennis team, all while maintaining above average grades. KEY Club is a service
 club that works to invest in charities both international and local. I graduated with honors and was within the top
 thirty in a class of over five hundred students. Outside of school, I was a member at First Baptist Church of 
 Moultrie. As a member, I was given many opportunities to volunteer in the community and I took advantage of as many
 of those chances that I could. <em>I believe it is important to give back to the community that I came from because they
 raised me and made me into who I am today.</em>

 <a href="http://www.uga.edu/"><b>College</b></a>
 </h2>
 <p>
 I began my freshman year of college at <abbr title="The University of Georgia">UGA</abbr> in the fall of 2016. Entering the first semester, I
 had not declared a major. I was still uncertain what I wanted to do in the future, not even knowing what field I wanted
 to enter. Finally during my second semester, I decided to double major in sport management and communication studies. I
 am currently still majoring in both, and I plan on completing a major in both. Outside of normal school activities, I
 have continued to volunteer. In my freshman year, I volunteered as a mentor to a fourth grader with the CrossTrainers
 program. This program allowed me to meet multiple times a month to spend time with a kid who was from a rough background.
 I got to do whatever activities I wanted with him, which usually consisted of playing basketball or football. Aside from
 volunteering, I also participate in intramural sports. I have played basketball, ultimate frisbee, and flag football.

 <h2>
 <b>Future</b>
 </h2>
 <p>
 As of right now, my future is uncertain. I plan on getting a job in the sports industry, but I do not know exactly what I
 want to do in the industry. I would also like to go through a graduate program for sport management business. However, it
 is up in the air right now. The only thing that is certain now is that when I complete my undergraduate degree, I do not
 want to immediately attend graduate school. I want to work for at least a year so that I can make some money before spending
 a lot on future schooling. I plan on staying in Georgia, but if a job outside of the state presents itself to me, I would
 be willing to move. The future makes me nervous, but I think I will be prepared when the time comes to make major life
 decisions.
